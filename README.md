# WATGEN-wateranalysis
This is a trial script for water analysis-analyzing watgen results. 

#Watgen is one of our house codes designated to solvate selected PDB structure.

Sample data file: Watgen result(water.out) and wateranalysis result (compare.out) is attached.
We want to re-examine the water analysis result and rematch the waters based on shortest distance between water molecule alone.
